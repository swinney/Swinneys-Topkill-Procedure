<BLOCKQUOTE><i>
Swinney.org provides an outlet of sorts to kindred
spirits across this land. Those creative souls that feel the
darkness of jobs, school and oppressive family units bearing
down on them at all times.<BR>--wb

</p>


<p class="subheader"><b>who writes on swinney.org?</b></p>
<p>
anyone! <a href="submit_article.phtml">including you</a>, if you want.
</p>

<p>
in the past, <a href="roll_call_all.phtml">these people</a> have
written on swinney.org. 
</p>

<p class="subheader"><b>do i have to sign up or log in or something?</b></p>
<p>
no, you don't have to sign up. just <a
href="submit_article.phtml">submit an article here</a>. if you write more than
once, and use the same name every time, it will be easier for people to
find what you've written, but it's not a rule or anything.
</p>


<p class="subheader"><b>what should i write?</b></p>

<p> 
anything you want! articles have consisted of anything from bad
haiku to someone's irc chat logs to harrowing tales of near death.
</p>

<p> 
carefully constructed texts and thoughtful rambles are always
appreciated. you know, <i>writing</i>.  
</p>

<p> 
this isn't a BBS and this isn't a mailing list. articles that make us
feel like this is a BBS or a mailing list might not make it through
our not-so-rigorous editorial process.  Cyantist has a good article
about this: <a
href="http://swinney.org/journals/article.phtml?id=935.txt">who
censor's the censor?</a>
</p>

<p class="subheader"><b>who will read what i write?</b></p>

<p> no one can really say who reads what on this here internet, though
<a href="http://stats.saturn5.com/swinney.org/">there are
stats</a>. all you can really bet is that some of the people who write
on swinney.org a lot also read swinney.org a lot, so they will
probably read what you write.  </p>

<p class="subheader"><b>ok i wrote something, how come it isn't showing up?</b></p>

<p>
swinney.org has a group of people who "activate" the things you
write so everyone can see them.
</p>

<p>
sometimes the person activating decides what you wrote didn't
have enough content or was a mistaken submission. sometimes we are just lazy and
didn't go and activate the article yet. rarely, but sometimes,
whatever you wrote just gets vetoed for nebulous editorial purposes.
</p>


<p class="subheader"><b>how come i commented on something and it was there, but then disappeared?</b></p>

<p>
swinney.org is not a place to come if you define yourself by the
ability to kick others down, or kick them when they are down.  also,
dont come here to be annoying.  be thoughtful.  be challenging.  do
not be a prick.  this site is moderated by a hand full of fair people
who are not annoying or mean.  if your comment was removed and you feel
it was done so unjustly, email <a
href="mailto:editors@swinney.org">editors@swinney.org</a>.
