if there is no blurb, then put in article #2345 or just dont echo
anything.  right now it echos <P></P> i think which creates an
annoying blank line.

porny.swinney.org or to say it better subdomain.swinney.org

this needs to some how use the same code that is already around?  wb
wants this.  i want to see it too.  i just dont know how to go about doing it.  perhaps a shit load of if statements like:

if (isset(SUB)) {
   $res = mysql("SELECT * FROM tablename_SUB");
} else {
   $res = mysql("SELECT * FROM tablename");
} # er something like that
