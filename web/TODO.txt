user area for editing articles, /journals/vip or swinney.org/vip?
										
user authentication in there is forwarding to the wrong swinney.org...

porny.swinney.org or to say it better subdomain.swinney.org

this needs to some how use the same code that is already around?  wb
wants this.  i want to see it too.  i just dont know how to go about doing it.  perhaps a shit load of if statements like:

if (isset(SUB)) {
   $res = mysql("SELECT * FROM tablename_SUB");
} else {
   $res = mysql("SELECT * FROM tablename");
} # er something like that
